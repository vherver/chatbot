This is a Django 5 + Django REST Framework project that provides an API for starting and managing debate-style conversations with an AI bot powered by OpenAI.


This project is a **Django + DRF** API containerized with Docker.  
It provides a chatbot that debates with the user based on a topic and stance inferred from messages.  
It also includes **Swagger documentation** and a **Postman collection** for easy testing.

make install     # Install requirements and build Docker images
make run         # Run the service + dependencies (e.g. Postgres)
make test        # Run tests inside Docker
make down        # Stop running services
make clean       # Stop and remove containers, networks, volumes
```
